- see what's happening in your network that you might want to get in on
- join the site to go do things with a specific group,just friends, just friends and friends of friends, or anyone
- confirm attendance to an event only if you will show up
- check in on the app when you get to an event to update attendees list and show you keep your word
- when you see current events you'll see who said they'll go, their reliability % and who is already there.
- nobody has to create an event for one to be suggested. If there are enough people with the same interest, the same availability, and if everything needed can be contributed, then you will get a notification asking you if you want to join in.
